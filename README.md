#Weather Prediction System
A fully containerized weather prediction application deployed on Kubernetes, leveraging MLFlow for model tracking, Airflow for pipeline orchestration, and Flask for serving predictions.

Features
Predicts weather using trained machine learning models.
Fully containerized using Docker for portability and ease of deployment.
Scalable deployment on Kubernetes.
Tracks experiments with MLFlow.
Automates workflows with Airflow.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Docker
Kubernetes (Minikube or any Kubernetes cluster)
kubectl
Python 3.8+
Helm (for Kubernetes package management)
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-prediction-system.git  
cd weather-prediction-system  
2. Build Docker Images
Build images for the app, MLFlow server, and any other required components.

bash
Copy code
docker-compose build  
3. Start MLFlow Server
Set up MLFlow to track experiments.

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up mlflow  
Access MLFlow at http://localhost:5000.

4. Deploy Airflow
Navigate to the Airflow directory and deploy it using Docker Compose.

bash
Copy code
cd airflow  
docker-compose up  
Access Airflow at http://localhost:8080.

5. Kubernetes Deployment
Ensure Kubernetes is running. If youâ€™re using Minikube, start it:

bash
Copy code
minikube start  
Deploy the application to Kubernetes:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml  
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml  
Verify the pods and services:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods  
kubectl get services  
Expose the service externally (if not already configured):

bash
Copy code
kubectl expose deployment weather-predictor --type=LoadBalancer --name=weather-service  
Retrieve the external IP to access the application:

bash
Copy code
minikube service weather-service --url  
Running the Application
Access the Flask API:

Use the URL from the minikube service command or Kubernetes service.
Make a Prediction:
Send a POST request with weather input data:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"input_data": [temperature, humidity, wind_speed]}' \
http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:5000/predict  
Monitor Airflow and MLFlow:

Airflow: http://localhost:8080
MLFlow: http://localhost:5000
Cleaning Up
Stop and remove all containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down  
Stop Minikube (if using):

bash
Copy code
minikube stop  
Future Enhancements
Add extreme weather alerts.
Integrate IoT data for real-time updates.
Experiment with advanced models for improved accuracy.
